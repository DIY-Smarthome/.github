# Hey, welcome to the DIY-Smarthome organization! ðŸ‘‹

The DIY-Smarthome ecosystem started originally as a project in university and evolved into a fun project for smarthome modules in a highly dynamic context without any data collection.

## Current status

We recently (09/2022) submitted our prototype as an exam in university. We exceeded our expectations and already started encrypted communication. But there is still a long way to go: Currently, the project is still a proof-of-concept/protoype, nothing for "production use".\
We will continue developing in our free time as a fun project and invite you to collaborate with us!

## TODOs for the near future

* Finish implementation of encrypted communication
* Properly start each module as an indepentent process
* Move towards a selfmanaged microservice-like process management
* Properly document every module

## Contributing to the ecosystem
